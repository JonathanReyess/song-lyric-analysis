# Temporal and Genre-Wide Analysis of Song Lyric Data
Authors: Zane Harrison, Joe Laforet, Jonathan Reyes, Felipe Vallejo

# Motivation 

This was my team's final project in LINGUISTICS 211: Computational Approaches to Human Language at Duke University, where we performed textual analysis on a collection of song lyrics spanning different genres and decades, motivated by the transcultural and timeless nature of music as an art form using SAS's textual and visual analysis tools. We were curious as to what insights could be drawn by examining the words, terms, and phrases that make up the lyrics to popular songs and how various topics, themes, and sentiments have changed over the course of several decades between different music genres. 

# Data Processing 

We utilized an open-soruce dataset containing over 18,000 songs on Kaggle that contained songs from a variety of genres and decades. We chose to particularly examine songs from the rock, pop, rap, and R&B genres across the 1980’s, 1990’s, 2000’s, 2010’s, and 2020’s.
