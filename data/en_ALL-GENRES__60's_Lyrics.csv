lyrics
"I've been rundown I've been lied to I don't know why I let that mean woman make me a fool She took all my money Wrecked my new car Now she's with one of my good-time buddies They're drinking in some cross-town bar Sometimes I feel Sometimes I feel Like I've been tied To the whipping post Tied to the whipping post Tied to the whipping post Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying My friends tell me That I've been such a fool And I have to stand down and take it, babe All for loving you I drown myself in sorrow As I look at what you've done Nothing seems to change Bad times stay the same And I can't run Sometimes I feel Sometimes I feel Like I've been tied To the whipping post Tied to the whipping post Tied to the whipping post Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying Sometimes I feel Sometimes I feel Like I've been tied To the whipping post Tied to the whipping post Tied to the whipping post Good Lord, I feel like I'm dying"
"My death is like A swinging door A patient girl who knows the score Whistle for her And the passing time My death waits like A bible truth At the funeral of my youth Weep loud for that And the passing time My death waits like A witch at night And surely as our love is bright Let's laugh for us And the passing time But whatever is behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil I don't care For in front of that door There is you My death waits like A beggar blind Who sees the world with an unlit mind Throw him a dime For the passing time My death waits To allow my friends A few good times before it ends Let's drink to that And the passing time My death waits in Your arms, your thighs Your cool fingers will close my eyes Let's not talk about The passing time But whatever is behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil I don't care For in front of that door There is you My death waits Among the falling leaves In magicians, mysterious sleeves Rabbits, dogs And the passing time My death waits Among the flowers Where the blackest shadow cowers Let's pick lilacs For the passing time My death waits in A double bed Sails of oblivion at my head Pull up the sheets Against the passing time But whatever is behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil I don't care For in front of that door There is you"
"You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off  of you You'd be like Heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much At long last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off you Pardon the way that I stare There's nothing else to compare The sight of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel like I feel Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off you I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night I love you, baby, trust in me when I say: Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay And let me love you, baby, let me love you You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You'd be like Heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much At long last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off you I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night I love you, baby, trust in me when I say: Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay Oh, pretty baby, trust in me when I say"

"I was never spellbound by a starry sky What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by Then there came a midnight and the world was new Now here am I so spellbound, darling Not by stars, but just by you At last my love has come along My lonely days are over and life is like a song At last the skies above are blue My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you I found a dream that I can speak to A dream that I can call my own I found a thrill to press my cheek to A thrill I've never known You smiled and then the spell was cast And here we are in Heaven For you are mine at last At last my love has come along My lonely days are over and life is like a song At last the skies above are blue My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you I found a dream that I can speak to A dream that I can call my own I found a thrill to press my cheek to A thrill I've never known You smiled and then the spell was cast And here we are in Heaven"
"Huh, huh, huh Please allow me to introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste I've been around for a long, long year Stole many a man's soul and faith I was 'round when Jesus Christ Had his moment of doubt and pain Made damn sure that Pilate Washed his hands and sealed his fate Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game I stuck around St. Petersburg When I saw it was a time for a change Killed the Czar and his ministers Anastasia screamed in vain I rode a tank, held a general's rank When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game I watched with glee while your kings and queens Fought for ten decades for the gods they made I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""When after all, it was you and me Let me please introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste And I laid traps for troubadours Who get killed before they reach Bombay Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game Oh yeah, get down heavy! NA Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game Just as every cop is a criminal And all the sinners saints As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer Cause I'm in need of some restraint So if you meet me, have some courtesy Have some sympathy, and some taste Use all your well-learned politesse Or I'll lay your soul to waste Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game NA"

"I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph He blew his mind out in a car He didn't notice that the lights had changed A crowd of people stood and stared They'd seen his face before Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords I saw a film today, oh boy The English Army had just won the war A crowd of people turned away But I just had to look Having read the book I'd love to turn you on NA Woke up, fell out of bed Dragged a comb across my head Found my way downstairs and drank a cup And looking up I noticed I was late Found my coat and grabbed my hat Made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke And somebody spoke and I went into a dream I read the news today, oh boy 4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire And though the holes were rather small They had to count them all Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall I'd love to turn you on NA"

"Like a sound you hear That lingers in your ear But you can't forget From sundown to sunset It's all in the air You hear it everywhere No matter what you do It's gonna grab a hold on you California soul, California soul They say the sun comes up every morning And if you listen carefully The winds that ride on the high time Whistle a melody And so the people started to sing And that's how the surf gave birth untold California soul, California soul When you hear the beat You wanna pat your feet And you've got to move Cause it's really such a groove Puts a brand new kind of thinking in your mind And you can't go wrong Cause you're groovin' all day long California soul, California soul They had the melody and the beat But it still didn't seem complete Until they saw two lovers kissin' They knew just what was missin' So happy they were rockin' and reelin' Because they added that lovin' feeling To California soul, California soul California soul California California California"

Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east Gone to choose And wandering's brother walked on through the night With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife Of GT The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn Until we said so long to his skull Shrill yell Shining brightly red rimmed and red lined with the time Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks From the bells Cut mouth bleeding razors Forgetting the pain Antiseptic remains cool, good buy So you fly To the cozy brown snow of the east Gonna choose, choose again Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget Where you come from the stools of your eyes Serve to realize fame Choose again And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse For the loss of a horse With the bowels and a tail of a rat Come again, choose to go And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame Have your head bobbed and weaved Choose a side to be on And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two Leave the color of the mouse trails Don't scream, try between If you choose If you choose, try to lose For the loss of remain come and start Start the game I che che, che che I Che che che, ka tah koh Choose to choose Choose to choose, choose to go"

Funny how my memory skips While looking over manuscripts Of unpublished rhyme Drinking my vodka and lime I look around Leaves are brown now And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Look around Leaves are brown There's a patch of snow on the ground...

"Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by The flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dared Disturb the sound of silence ""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you"" But my words, like silent raindrops, fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said: ""The words of the prophets are Written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sound of silence."""
