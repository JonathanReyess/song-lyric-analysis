"Who are you? Who, who, who, who? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? Who are you? Who, who, who, who? I woke up in a Soho doorway A policeman knew my name He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight If you can get up and walk away""I staggered back to the underground And the breeze blew back my hair I remember throwing punches around And preaching from my chair Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) I took the tube back out of town Back to the Rolling Pin I felt a little like a dying clown With a streak of Rin Tin Tin I stretched back and I hiccupped And looked back on my busy day Eleven hours in the Tin Pan God, there's got to be another way Oh wa oh wa oh wa oh wa Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you?

I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) I know there's a place you walked Where love falls from the trees My heart is like a broken cup I only feel right on my knees I spit out like a sewer hole Yet still receive your kiss How can I measure up to anyone now After such a love as this? Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Tell me whoa are you(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Tell me, tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Come on, come on, who? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, tell me who are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) I really wanna know Oh, I really wanna know Come on tell me, who are you, you, you, you? Who are you?"

"No, I can't forget this evening Or your face as you were leaving But I guess that's just the way the story goes You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows Yes, it shows No, I can't forget tomorrow When I think of all my sorrow When I had you there but then I let you go And now it's only fair that I should let you know What you should know I can't live if living is without you I can't live, I can't give anymore I can't live if living is without you I can't give, I can't give anymore Well, I can't forget this evening Or your face as you were leaving But I guess that's just the way the story goes You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows Yes, it shows Can't live if living is without you I can't live, I can't give anymore I can't live if living is without you I can't live, I can't give anymore Living is without you"
"I make it half past six, you come at seven Always try to keep me hanging round You little spoilt thing, girl, you kept me waiting Never contemplating my point of view This comes as no surprise I'm a fool for I believed your lies But now I've seen through your disguise Who needs, well, I don't need Who needs you? Oh, I believed you Went on my knees to you How I trusted you But you turned me down But it's dog eat dog in this rat race And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face Reaching out reaching out for a helping hand (Where is that helping hand?) Oh, muchachos I like it, I like it Well, I don't need you How I was pushed around Don't let it get you down You walked all over me But don't you ever give in Taking one step forward slipping two steps back There's an empty feeling that you can't forget Reaching out for a helping hand When I met you, you were always charming Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine You were, oh, so, so sophisticated Never interested in what I'd say I had to swallow my pride So naive you took me for a ride But now I'm the one to decide Who needs, well, I don't need Who needs you?"
For criminal acts and violence on the stage For being a brat refusing to act your age For all of the decent citizens you've enraged You can go to Hell For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly For making us doubt our parents authority For choosing to be a living obscenity You can go to Hell You're something that never should have happened You even make your Grandma sick You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane You'd gift wrap a leper And mail him to your Aunt Jane You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane You can go to Hell You're something that never should have happened You even make your Grandma sick For criminal acts and violence on the stage For being a brat refusing to act your age For all of the decent citizens you've enraged You can go to Hell
"There's no living in my life anymore The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling Please don't you cry anymore (Ahh) Can't you see? Listen to the breeze, whisper to me, please Don't send me to the path of nevermore Even the valleys below Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender Now haven't anything to grow (Ahh) Can't you see? Why did you have to leave me? (Nevermore, nevermore) Why did you deceive me? (Nevermore, nevermore) You send me to the path of nevermore (Ahh) When you say you didn't love me anymore (A-a-a-a-a-a-ahh) (Ahh) Nevermore Nevermore"
"Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night And wouldn't you love to love her? Takes to the sky like a bird in flight And who will be her lover? All your life you've never seen a woman Taken by the wind Would you stay if she promised you heaven? Will you ever win? She is like a cat in the dark And then she is the darkness She rules her life like a fine skylark And when the sky is starless Once in a million years a lady like her rises Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer All your life you've never seen a woman Taken by the wind Would you stay if she promised you heaven?

"Monday Start of my holiday Freedom for just one week Feels good to get away Ooh, ooh Tuesday Saw her down on the beach I stood and watched a while And she looked and smiled at me Wednesday, I didn't see her I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow And then on Thursday My luck had changed She stood there all alone I went and asked her name I never thought that this could happen to me In only seven days It would take a hundred or more For memories to fade I wish Friday Would last forever I held her close to me I couldn't bear to leave her there Saturday Just twenty-four hours Oh no, I'm going back home on Sunday I'm so sad Alone"

"A long, long time ago... I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Do you believe in rock 'n' roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him `Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned; No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance! `Cause the players tried to take the field; The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick! Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singing Bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets: the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken;The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most: The father, son, and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised him everything I could give If only he would make the music live And he promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die ""This'll be the day that I die."" They were singing Bye-bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, ""This'll be the day that I die"""

"It's the sad-eyed goodbye Yesterday moments I remember It's the bleak street Weak-kneed partings I recall It's the mistier mist, the hazier days The brighter sun and the easier lays There's all the more reason for laughing and crying When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays That bored you to rages of tears The unending pleadings to waste all your good times In thoughts of your middle-aged years It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told For the everyday hero, it all turns to zero And there's all the more reason for living or dying When you're young and your troubles are all very small Out here on the street, we'd gather and meet And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet And half of the time, we'd broaden our minds more In the pool hall than we did in the school hall With the downtown chewing-gum bums Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun Never wanted to be the boy next door Always thought I'd be something more But it ain't easy for a smalltown boy It ain't easy at all Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong It's easier from an armchair Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess I think I'll be Clint Eastwood Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good Let's try William the Conqueror Now who else do I like?"

"The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose the devil gets your soul The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show."" And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this: When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""""Fire on the Mountain"" Run, boys, run!

Ahh!We come from the land of the ice and snow From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow How soft your fields so green Can whisper tales of gore Of how we calmed the tides of war We are your overlords On we sweep with threshing oar Our only goal will be the western shore So now you'd better stop And rebuild all your ruins For peace and trust can win the day Despite of all your losing"

Only mine's broke down And now I've no one to love So I found out your reasons For the phone calls and smiles And it hurts and I'm lonely And I should never have tried And I miss you tonight So it's time to leave You see it meant everything to me"

"One day, in the year of the fox Came a time remembered well When the strong young man of the rising sun Heard the tolling of the big black bell One day in the year of the fox When the bell began to ring It meant the time had come for one to go To the temple of the king There in the middle of the circle he stands Searching, seeking With just one touch of his trembling hand The answer will be found Daylight waits while the old man sings Heaven help me! And then like the rush of a thousand wings It shines upon the one And the day has just begun (Uh uh uhh...) One day, in the year of the fox Came a time remembered well When the strong young man of the rising sun Heard the tolling of the great black bell One day in the year of the fox When the bell began to sing It meant the time had come for one to go To the temple of the king There in the middle of the people he stands Seeing, feeling With just a wave of the strong right hand, he's gone To the temple of the king Far from the circle, at the edge of the world He's hoping, wondering Thinking back on the stories he's heard of What he's going to see There, in the middle of a circle it lies Heaven help me! Then all could see by the shine in his eyes The answer had been found Back with the people in the circle he stands Giving, feeling With just one touch of a strong right hand, they know Of the temple and the king (Uh uh uhh...)"
