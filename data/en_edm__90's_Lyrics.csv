"No, don't stop Just feel me all the way to the top With your love there's no empty Just give me everything that you've got All alone, I don't want to be Without you, just within me Making love to you so have it I've just got to have it Don't even think about leaving me Oh, oh, because I can't get enough I can't get enough No, no, no, no I can't get enough I can't get enough Don't was it not enough No, you won't hurt me, just please me Don't deserve me And I, I dream of you All the time that we share and the things we do All alone, I don't want to be Without you, just within me Making love to you so have it I've just got to have it Don't even think about leaving me No, because I can't get enough I can't get enough No, no, no, no I can't get enough I can't get enough Don't was it not enough Not enough (repeat) All alone, I don't want to be Without you, just within me Making love to you so have it I've just got to have it Don't even think about leaving me No, because I can't get enough I can't get enough No, no, no, no I can't get enough I can't get enough Don't was it not enough"
"Come with me, our game has just begun Take my hand, we're gonna have some fun In the suite, thats what they all tell me Incomplete, see all their fingers pointing I say love's what I want, who can take me high Out into space, only shooting love For the moment it's there Though it's hard to bare, out in the cold Time is right, I'm only shooting love Times tonight, thats what I'm thinkin of It's allright ooh, I'm only shooting love Times tonight ooh, I buy it to you till your high enough I don't want to make some sort of fuss Thats not what I want to do I just need some trust I say love's what I want, who can take me high Out into space, only shooting love For the moment he's there Though it's hard to bare, out in the cold Time is right, I'm only shooting love Times tonight, thats what I'm thinkin of It's allright ooh, I'm only shooting love Times tonight ooh, I buy it to you till your high enough I say love's what I want, who can take me high Out into space, only shooting love For the moment he's there Though it's hard to bare, out in the cold Time is right, I'm only shooting love Times tonight, thats what I'm thinkin of It's allright ooh, I'm only shooting love Times tonight ooh, I buy it to you till your high enough"
