"Maybe I didn't treat you Quite as good as I should Maybe I didn't love you Quite as often as I could Little things I should have said and done I never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Maybe I didn't hold you All those lonely lonely times And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine If I made you feel second best I'm so sorry I was blind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Tell me Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died Give me One more chance to keep you satisfied Satisfied Little things I should have said and done I never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Tell me Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died Give me One more chance to keep you satisfied You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine (Maybe I didn't love you...) Maybe I didn't treat you Quite as good as I should Maybe I didn't love you Quite as often as I could Little things I should have said and done I never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Maybe I didn't hold you All those lonely lonely times And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine If I made you feel second best I'm so sorry I was blind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Tell me Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died Give me One more chance to keep you satisfied Satisfied Little things I should have said and done I never took the time You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Tell me Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died Give me One more chance to keep you satisfied You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind You were always on my mind Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine (Maybe I didn't love you...)"

"Whoa, oh, yeah (Ah) I gotta new life You would hardly recognize me I'm so glad How could a person like me care for you? (Ah) Why do I bother When you're not the one for me Ooh, is enough, enough? I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign Life is demanding without understanding I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong... But where do you belong? (Ah) Under the pale moon For so many years I've wondered who you are How could a person like you bring me joy? Under the pale moon Where I see a lot of stars Ooh is enough, enough? I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign Life is demanding without understanding I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong... But where do you belong? Oh, oh oh! NA I saw the sign and it opened up my mind! And I am happy now living without you I've left you, oh-oh-OH! I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong (I saw the sign - I saw the si-i-ign) I saw the sign! (I saw the sign - I saw the si-ig-i-ign) (I saw the sign - I saw the sign) i saw the sign! And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign!"
"I was taken by surprise I was shattered by your eyes Living far beyond my means Do you know how that feels? I was waiting for so long I was praying to belong Only holding out to see and believing There's only one strong enough And hard enough to give you away In this big area of mine Sometimes you break me up inside Saying I, I want to let you go Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you Long enough will give you away There was never one as I Who could stand the reasons why Who would even take the time Did you care, was I right? Only once did you try Even then it was hard enough Just for you to realize or believe There was only one strong enough Or hard enough to give you away In this big area of mine Sometimes you break me up inside Saying I, I want to let you go Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you Long enough will give you away In this big area In this big area of mine Sometimes you break me up inside Saying I, I want to let you go Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you Long enough will give you away Sometimes you break me up inside In this big area of life Saying I, I wnat to let you go Got that feeling if anyone who comes to know you Long enough will give you away I was taken by surprise I was shattered by your eyes Breaking down Something so right and so fine"

A green plastic watering can For a fake Chinese rubber plant In a fake plastic earth That she bought from a rubber man In a town full of rubber plans To get rid of itself It wears her out It wears her out It wears her out It wears her out She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles and burns He used to do surgery For girls in the 80s But gravity always wins And it wears him out It wears him out It wears him out It wears... She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run And it wears me out It wears me out It wears me out It wears me out And if I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted All the time All the time
