lyrics
"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me Somebody I can love for them All this money don't mean shit If you ain't got nobody to share it with Love rules the world, you feel me He don't understand you like I do No he'll never make love to you like I do So give it to me Cause I can show you 'bout a real love And I can promise anything that I do Is just to satisfy you When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but We one in the same girl, it ain't a game So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you In good and bad times, we'll always make it through Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you I could straight lace you, not just appearance Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void When you spend time with your woman and listen It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt And prove to you you're more important than anything else Worthwhile, special like my first child When I see your face it's always like the first time Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to Let it be known, I told you And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby) Waiting for love like this too long (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby) All that you need I can give you (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on) I do, satisfy you (You don't have to wait on him) I'm the light when you can't see I'm that air when you can't breathe I'm that feeling when you can't leave Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive So it's only you and me When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong Keep you away from harm, my love is protected I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil Make love all night, bending bed coils You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal This is all for you, cause I simply adore you until fade This one right here goes out to all my sisters"

A green plastic watering can For a fake Chinese rubber plant In a fake plastic earth That she bought from a rubber man In a town full of rubber plans To get rid of itself It wears her out It wears her out It wears her out It wears her out She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles and burns He used to do surgery For girls in the 80s But gravity always wins And it wears him out It wears him out It wears him out It wears... She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run And it wears me out It wears me out It wears me out It wears me out And if I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted All the time All the time

Crazy, some'd say Where is the life that I recognize? Gone away But I won't cry for yesterday There's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way To the ordinary world I will learn to survive Passion or coincidence Once prompted you to say ""Pride will tear us both apart"" Well now pride's gone out the window Cross the rooftops Run away Left me in the vacuum of my heart What is happening to me?

A million men in uniform Wo ist der führer* der mich führt? Ich warte immer noch And God is on your side Dividing presence from the history Watching all the time Dividing deaf men from the listening ones And God is on your side Dividing soldiers from the fisherman Watching all the time Dividing warships from the ferryboats"

(laughs) born in the underground of Newark Now witness the birth of Mr. Funkee The fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funky Kreuger A.K. Anger, we told 'em Mr. Funkee Wallbanger Conceived in the fire by a war through disasters The funky child was taught to the ways of the masters Mr. Funkee, yes, girl, the black mack is back Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that You can work day and night, you could practice all your life But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy I hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?!) Uncle (Who?!) When I was young I used to sing with my sister (Heyy) Now I kick the ill styles, you have to call me mister Cooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild Raised in the ways of the funky child Back up baby, here comes the stroller We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' rolla I'm caught in the swinging hypnotized by the Pendulum Distributed by Elektra, so this is how I'm killing them K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technic Marley's on the mix, and now the Lords have a hit like POW! Now it's time to get buckwild And watch my funky brothers freak the underground In a second, or minute, in no times flat... Bring it back! And go grab the album to bring the Lords money Take it home to mom to say, ""Ain't they funky?"" We gone psycho and everbody thought we was DAS It didn't affect me, I said, ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on!) Don't worry not for other crews selling out As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business You might say, ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's going out!"" But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about Any props you receive are the props that you earn I'm off 'til the funky child returns"

Shakedown 1979 Cool kids never have the time On a live wire right up off the street You and I should meet Junebug skippin' like a stone With the headlights pointed at the dawn We were sure we'd never see an end To it all And I don't even care To shake these zipper blues And we don't know Just where our bones will rest To dust I guess Forgotten and absorbed Into the earth below Double-cross the vacant and the bored They're not sure just what we have in store Morphine city slippin' dues Down to see That we don't even care As restless as we are We feel the pull In the land of a thousand guilts And poured cement Lamented and assured To the lights and towns below Faster than the speed of sound Faster than we thought we'd go Beneath the sound of hope Justine never knew the rules Hung down with the freaks and ghouls No apologies ever need be made I know you better than you fake it To see That we don't even care To shake these zipper blues And we don't know Just where our bones will rest To dust I guess Forgotten and absorbed Into the earth below The street heats the urgency of now As you see there's no one around

"Chorus Treat 'em like they wanna be treated You should treat 'em right (Repeat 4x's) Yeah, oh yeah What you need to do... You should treat them right Oh, yeah Why girls play with my feelings? I don't know so that's why I ask Maybe it's true that I set myself up But then again it's the question I asked I want someone for me who is straight A kind of cutie. Yes, yep, a smart mate I've been around searching for the right one But it seems like a waste of my time Every time that I meet the right 1 It seems as if she plays with my mind So it makes me on the defense side Because my offense is sort of slow It doesn't pay to tell someone ""I love you"" Because in my vocab ""I love u"" is a no, no I think I give in. My feelings, they show I think I'd better not look back I've been down a little too long And now it's time that I get on track So I must... Chorus I like to mingle when I do mingle I love to mingle when I do flirt I get off hand and tell the stories About my past & that's when it hurts But I need to find for me a lonesome lady type Who wants me for self A woman who wants me because of Father Not for the fame or for my wealth So I can ""Show her how I feel"" Yeah, ladies I'm not that picky But being picky is just for self I must protect what I respect And that is me & not someone else I've been mistreated up on the downhill Back in the days I used to be strong I used to flirt, hurt, kind of jerk Get the cash, the sex then I'm gone But payback is a mother And now I don't know who to trust So I just... Chorus Yeah, you know women? Yeah they tell me I'm lovely & cuddly but I just don't understand why they want to play with my feelings. But it won't happen again Nah, never (No, no no no no no...) So listen ladies I'll treat you How you treat me back in return I'm not rude. No, I'm not stuck up But my feelings are my main concern So don't think that I'd give in Cause now I know how to show My feelings when I get involved I'll take it slow before I say ""Oh, No"" I'll treat you like you treat me I'll be straight loyal & all So don't take advantage of Father Because I'll step up but not crawl So give me what you can give me Love, attention, a lot of respect I don't ask for a whole lot But I'm gone if you wanna step That's why I like to take it slow Not rush because I want more The next time that I fall in love Hmm, you bets I'll be sure (I'm gonna treat you...) Chorus So ladies... now y'all know how I'm living... & y'all know what I'm about. And that's the end. So if you feel you can commit, come & give it a shot"

"When I was little, my father was famous He was the greatest samurai in the empire And he was the Shogun's decapitator He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords It was a bad time for the empire The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out People said his brain was infected by devils My father would come home, he would forget about the killings He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him Maybe that was the problem Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't That was the night everything changed See, sometimes You gotta flash 'em back See niggas don't know where this shit started Y'all know where it came from I'm saying we gonna take y'all back to the source Do the knowledge, yo When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut Fake niggas get flipped In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend But it was your op to shop stolen art Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts That's minimum, and feminine like sandals My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble Energy is felt once the cards are dealt With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon I represent from midnight to high noon I don't waste ink, nigga, I think I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted Turn that shit up, my Clan in the front want it Now when the MCs came to live out the name and to perform Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible But when I swing my swords they all choppable I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper Child educator, plus head amputator'Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers Don't even stop in my station and attack While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak What the fuck for?

"NA Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss Always got mad when the class was dismissed But when it was in session, I always had a question I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and Help me with my problem, it was never much Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug She was married to the man, he was a thug His name was Lee, he drove a Z He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus First I'd write her name then carve a plus With my name last, on the looking glass I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by(Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on pa-- NA When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me That I should quit chasin' and look for something better But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga But, all I can do was stare Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer To get in her book and it looks rather dry I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride 'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when- Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her Wired her a letter to get her, and it went My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you When I try or make some sort of attempt, I symp Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you Then I signed sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on pa-- (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) Passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) (Nevertheless) (Nevertheless) (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again)"

Remember me So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears I suffered through the years And shed so many tears Lord, I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse God, can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain Show me some happiness again I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears Lord, I suffered through the years And shed so many tears Lord, I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me My every move is a calculated step To bring me closer to embrace an early death Now there's nothin' left There was no mercy on the streets I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin' About to go to pieces, screamin' peace And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game No memories, just a misery Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun? Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come Lord! (God!) I suffered through the years And shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high This ain't the life for me, I wanna change But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game I'm trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door Shed so many tears Lord, lost so many peers And shed so many tears I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Lord, I suffered many years And shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers And shed so many tears"

My friends say I should act my age What's my age again? What's my age again? Then later on On the drive home I called her mom From a payphone I said I was the cops And your husband's in jail This state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me Nobody likes you when you're 23 And are still more amused by prank phone calls What the hell is call ID? My friends say I should act my age What's my age again? What's my age again? And that's about the time she walked away from me Nobody likes you when you're 23 And you still act like you're in freshman year What the hell is wrong with me? My friends say I should act my age What's my age again? (What's my age again?) That's about the time that she broke up with me (Please stay with me) No one should take themselves so seriously (Please stay with me) With many years ahead to fall in line (Please stay with me) Why would you wish that on me?(Please stay) I never wanna act my age (With) What's my age again?

Shakedown 1979 Cool kids never have the time On a live wire right up off the street You and I should meet Junebug skippin' like a stone With the headlights pointed at the dawn We were sure we'd never see an end To it all And I don't even care To shake these zipper blues And we don't know Just where our bones will rest To dust I guess Forgotten and absorbed Into the earth below Double-cross the vacant and the bored They're not sure just what we have in store Morphine city slippin' dues Down to see That we don't even care As restless as we are We feel the pull In the land of a thousand guilts And poured cement Lamented and assured To the lights and towns below Faster than the speed of sound Faster than we thought we'd go Beneath the sound of hope Justine never knew the rules Hung down with the freaks and ghouls No apologies ever need be made I know you better than you fake it To see That we don't even care To shake these zipper blues And we don't know Just where our bones will rest To dust I guess Forgotten and absorbed Into the earth below The street heats the urgency of now As you see there's no one around

"May I have your attention please The following is a brief introduction to the concept of the sunshine men Keep in mind that all instances that follow are fact and now our anthem Recently I've seen MCs comin' thru While was at home, on my couch, watchin' the boob tube Fightin' like a rough neck, just to stay loose As I sat and wrote rhymes on a page like mother goose This was the problem, results of a test The heart of all wackness, lies rooted out west Right smack dab inside my civilization The hunt for an MC brings investigation What I mean is basically there's no one Who comes off correct and stands in the sun Of Cal., but here comes the change up in trend The world debut intro to the Sunshine Men NA Let me explain this, clearly and plain About the journey of the brothers who missed this train Towards sellout When I profile rhymes go straight out the window We're not like regular bimbos We're sunshine men Just a definition of those in this hot spot who despise the system One composed of an inferior peer group Pollutin' the airwaves and I got the scoop On radio, it's all about your cash flow Pay for airplay, or you fly solo Only one brother can come up off this Those without talents, but big drug profits Rap becomes a tool often used in vain Just like a gun When they want out of the insane lifestyle But they want the insane pay So they pick up a mic, yet they have nothing to say It's a damn shame, cause they form the pack Of those who represent my spot, yet they lack The skill to get raw with words and cold shoot 'em Stuck in the past, puttin' raps to a drum computer Not even worried that the songs not able Cause they got juice and hook-ups at big labels No unique-ness, no goals or dreams No creativity's exactly how it seems As a sunshine man, with plans and a pen in my hand Recordin' thoughts and beats for the next man Even those who live without a clue I bring the truth to you, it's not new To help my cause, the rise or inflation The incline of western civilization Words to enlighten and to direct Brought to you live and correct From Sunshine Men NA NA Why in the world is every one down with sunshine? None of them from here, but the attitude's clear They stroll like kings, the big fish in a small stream Too weak to battle so they fled the big apple And they moved out west like old settlers Booty MCs, no rhymes, with a swelled head Aimin' to discover an inactive rhyme zone Just like Columbus, they called here home So they moved in and started a new trend West Coast stars made from East Coast pollution Native MCs never got the game plan So they grabbed the trumpets and hopped in the band But no, not me, neither I, nor D(?) Seeks to shade from sunshine Underneath trees of confusion Because this illusion is grim We choose to stay clear minded As sunshine men"

"See, most of my life I never had shit I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth Thinking, ""Was I really supposed to be on this planet earth?""I take a deep breath and then another follows 'Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow See, it's rough being a loner Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner See, people got it bad from jump-street And being short is just another strike against me I used to get funny looks 'cause I was small And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall Given the odds I was up against, bro The average nigga would've quit a long time ago But now I've got a record out I'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out Now, I'm the spice around town It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around I got friends and bitches on my dick But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe And every different day it's a different fuckin' ho And now that my pockets are getting bigger I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga They tell me that they love me and all that But really they just wait for me to fall flat So they can get me for my income Take me for all I got, and then some Like Trina, you dig? I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid Knowing that she used the baby to use me Took him out my life, mentally abusing me But as the time went by, I got another slimmy And she was just like the first one screaming, ""Gimme"" But not in the exact same way She had a different type of game she liked to play Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type And for a little while, shit seemed alright But just like the first ho, homie When shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me And it's getting out of hand, G 'Cause nobody seems to understand me Reminiscing got me feeling kinda low I broke out the Everclear and then I drunk some mo' Until it was all gone Now I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on But not just anybody, G I'ma take that on Tamica, 'cause she's the closest to me Full of that Everclear and high on that buddah Get to the house, all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her 'Cause shooting her would be sweet But you know what'd be sweeter? If I make her shoot me Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking I'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her She still wouldn't grab the gun And at that time, I wasn't thinking about no one Damn near crazy, I went and grabbed the baby (Bill! Gimme the baby! Gimme the baby!) Held him by the door and said I'ma throw his ass out, ho She went to crying, ""Somebody stop him""I said, ""You better grab the motherfuckin' gun or I'mma drop him"" She snatched the baby out of my hands We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting When we fell on the bed, check this shit All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head So I ran and got the gun and came back to her Loaded it up and handed the gat to her I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle She screamed, ""Stop,"" and then we broke into another tussle Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick Damn—Ah shit, I'm hit (Oh, Lord! Oh, Bill!) Ahh... my eye, I can't see (Oh, I'm so sorry!) Why you shot me in the eye? (Oh my God, somebody help me!) I would've shot you in the body (Oh, I'm sorry!) Why you shot me in the eye? Riding in the ambulance, everything is hectic I can't get a grip, I just can't check this Everybody's crying, could it be I'm dying? Bullet in my head, in the bed I was lying Where's 'Mica? I wanna tell her I love her With an IV in my arm, I took a picture for an album cover Goddamn, this shit's a trip, G Five different doctors with needles tryna stick me I hear my family hollering, ""He needs us!""During the confusion, man, I seen Jesus My mom's on the phone, long-distance, from New York Here comes the doctors again, trying to rip me apart I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake this I'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it But I'ma make it, 'cause something's steady urging me Five hours passed, I made it through surgery And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night But God told me, ""Everything is gonna be alright"" And I'm glad that I'm here, GBut it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly"

Genius (The Genius) The Genius, the Genius I'll grab the mic and I'll damage ya Crush your whole stamina Here comes the medical examiner One verse then you're out for the count Bring the ammonia, make sure he sniffs the right amount Wake him up and then ask him Why did he attend this -- Competition to get ass kickin' so tremendous Boy you know you shouldn't bother this Leave me alone like the son said G or he'll be fatherless! I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Cristo And MCs start to vanish I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin' Spanish! Yo he wasn't from Panama Asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntanama! He responded so fast, he made me laugh Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH then I scared-his ass! Kicked the hundred strongest rhymes I brought out the punk in him Caught him with a strong five deadly venom Told him enter the Wu-Tang Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring And watch your ass take a big fall, why?!My Main Source is like a friendly game of stickball And as you step up to bat man and I play the riddler Try to do me for a rhyme and I'll change to Hitler Go out like a Nazi; you'll be wishin' your fuckin' ass stayed home and played Yahtzee!

And when I perform a massacre Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular Crush the personal vendetta, well you just better Start stepping to your raggedy ass jetta Put the pedal to the metal You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle As I pass the bone, kicks your every measure It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensimilli Rolled up in a Motown Philly I used to write all the time when I smoked Grab the mic, then I like kinda went for broke With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps Lyrically speakin', three to four rhymes a choke Some think they be harmin' this, claimin' they be bombin' this But they still remains anonymous I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix Rhyme on beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks I teach the truth to the youth, I say, ""hey youth Here's the truth, better start wearing bulletproof"" Arm yourself with a shield'Fore you get trapped up just like the children in the cornfield"
"He deals the cards as a meditation And those he plays never suspect He doesn't play for the money he wins He doesn't play for respect He deals the cards to find the answer The sacred geometry of chance The hidden law of a probable outcome The numbers lead a dance I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart He may play the jack of diamonds He may lay the queen of spades He may conceal a king in his hand While a memory of it fades I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart That's not the shape, the shape of my heart NA And if I told you that I loved you You'd maybe think there's something wrong I'm not a man of too many faces The mask I wear is one But those who speak know nothing And find out to their cost Like those who curse their luck in too many places And those who fear are lost I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart That's not the shape of my heart That's not the shape, the shape of my heart"

"(So what you gonna do when you get outta here cat daddy?) I don't know dawg. I'm just trying to live it one day at a time, ya know? (I hear you talkin' man, live it one day at a time...) (It ain't nothing but a thang though, bro) Yeah I hear you fool... Well let me get up outta here, my ride out here waitin' for me (Alright cat daddy, take it easy baby) You stay up fool (Peace) He greets his father with his hands out Rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child The world is different since he's seen it last Out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last All he had was his mother's letters Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better But he's black so he's got one strike against him And he's young, plus he came up in the system But he's smart and he's finally making eighteen And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean So he's calling up his homie who done came up Livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff And had that attitude that who he was was worth land And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man Now it's different, he done did dirt And realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt And can't nobody change this It's 1994 and we up against the same shit I never understood why I could never see a man cry 'til I seen a man die Imagine life at it's full peak Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy Imagine peace on this Earth when there's no grief Imagine grief on this Earth when there's no peace Everybody's got a different way of endin' it And when your number comes for souls, then they send it in Now your time has arrived for your final test I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath How much longer will it be 'til it's all done? Total darkness at ease be at all one I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate You took his life, but your memory you'll never take You'll be headed to another place And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face I still gotta wonder why I never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low Stop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here You start your journey into outer space You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place So you standing in the tunnel of eternal life And you see the ones you never learn to love in life Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up But if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free Here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace I still got to wonder why I never seen a man cry 'til I seen that man die"

"A lonely mother gazing out of the window Staring at a son that she just can't touch If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain't helping at all Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation But he just can't see She gives him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me""One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face His health is fading and he doesn't know why Three letters took him to his final resting place Y'all, don't hear me Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (Your way or no way) But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Come on!I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew Clear  blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein? What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane, and name this day in time For falling prey to crime I say the system's got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast) Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go) Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (I know, I know, your way hey) But I think you're moving too fast"

We have something in common It's the way we feel about each other when we're together VERSE 2: Sung by Whitney Now I'm the type of girl who understands my man I'll be strong when he's weak, I will hold his hand Now I believe old fashioned rules and old fashioned ways Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days You're my man and I'm your girl There's nothing better in this whole wide world I'll stand by your side till the very end All in all, best of love, we are friends CHORUS: with Whitney singing indented lines (see above) BRIDGE: Bobby: Girl you know it's you that I adore Whitney: And there's no one in this world that I love more"

Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far 'Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha Not knowin' exactly what lied ahead My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner ""Hey, Shorty, check it, run the bag and the dough!""

I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet I saw the blood all over the hot concrete I picked him up, then I held him by his head His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was… Aw man! How do I say goodbye? It's always the good ones that have to die Memories in the corner of my mind Flashbacks, of us laughin' all the time I taught him all about the bees and birds But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words After laughter comes tears Me and my man, my ace Big Moe from the shelter 'Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma Now, Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed Three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex!He seemed to ignore, I said, ""Be for real! She's not even worth it to go raw deal."" A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do He got butt-naked and stuck the power U Twenty minutes went by, Moe, I'm out without a doubt I'm not pumpin' up, I am airin' out Hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story But he carried on with the same old stuff With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck Moe tried to be down with O.P.P Ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the H.I.V Now no life to live, doc says two more years So after the laughter I guess comes the tears After laughter comes tears"
