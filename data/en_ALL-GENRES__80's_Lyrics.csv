lyrics
"Feels good Everybody Tender lover Tender love Eleanor Rigby spends half her life All alone No fault of her own Made a decision Love has no place in her home Love It has a right to go Love has no limit If you believe in love It'll open up so Don't even give in 'Cause if it starts to give Just hold on We didn't didn't make it But love'll get you by If you only try Just don't give up on love 'Cause it didn't work out this time Tender lover Girl, I'm so sorry Well I never meant to hurt you I never meant to break your heart Tender love So broken hearted Well I never meant to break your Break your little tender heart Don't ever give up in spite of our love Love is much too precious It's greater than both of us There's more than enough Keep looking for love Just be a believer It'll give you what you want Sky is the limit If you believe in love It'll open up so Don't ever give in 'Cause if it starts to give Just hold on We didn't Didn't make it But love'll get you by If you only try Just don't give up on love 'Cause it didn't work out this time My tender lover Tender lover Tender love NA"
"Standing in the rain, with his head hung low Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream He heard one guitar, just blew him away He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure That one guitar felt good in his hands Didn't take long to understand Just one guitar, slung way down low Was one way ticket, only one way to go So he started rocking He is never going to stop Got to keep on rocking Someday he's going to make it to the top And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He's a juke box hero He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes Juke box hero, he'll come alive tonight In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain And that one guitar made his whole life change Now he needs to keep on rockin' He just can't stop Gotta keep on rocking' Someday gonna make it to the top And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He's a juke box hero And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He took one guitar, stars in his eyes He'll come alive tonight woah NA Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin' Never gonna stop Gotta keep on rocking' Someday gonna make it to the top And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He's a juke box hero Yeah juke box hero, got stars in his eyes Juke box hero, ahh Juke box hero, ahh Juke box hero, got stars in his eyes Stars in his eyes Standing in the rain, with his head hung low Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream He heard one guitar, just blew him away He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure That one guitar felt good in his hands Didn't take long to understand Just one guitar, slung way down low Was one way ticket, only one way to go So he started rocking He is never going to stop Got to keep on rocking Someday he's going to make it to the top And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He's a juke box hero He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes Juke box hero, he'll come alive tonight In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain And that one guitar made his whole life change Now he needs to keep on rockin' He just can't stop Gotta keep on rocking' Someday gonna make it to the top And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He's a juke box hero And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He took one guitar, stars in his eyes He'll come alive tonight woah NA Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin' Never gonna stop Gotta keep on rocking' Someday gonna make it to the top And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes He's a juke box hero Yeah juke box hero, got stars in his eyes Juke box hero, ahh Juke box hero, ahh Juke box hero, got stars in his eyes Stars in his eyes"

"(Baby, don't go) No baby, no baby, no baby No No baby, no baby, no baby (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Don't wanna go) Even though I hate to leave girl For I cry as I walk out the door (The door, I cry) Temptation is asking me to stay But we've been through the same thing before I can't believe that this is happening to us We made vows to never be apart (Never, never, never, never) I turn my head to see if you're hurt 'Cause I also feel it deep in my heart You said you'd never leave me I said I'll never leave you But fairy tales don't always come true You promised to stay with me I promised to stay with you I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby 'Cause I'm saying bye bye My sunny days just ain't the same Every hour of the day brings me tears (I cry, too) So I guess I have to keep on hoping, wishing, praying That you are here (That you're here with me yeah) And I'd rather end this self misery than to go on Living without you And, and,  I I ask myself over and over again If leaving you makes me a fool Baby You said you'd never leave me I said I'll never leave you But fairy tales don't always come true You promised to stay with me I promised to stay with you I guess you knew, I guess you knew we blew a good thing Yeah, yeah 'Cause I'm saying bye bye Bye bye (Goodbye love) You know I'm saying bye bye (Goodbye love) Bye bye (Goodbye) Bye bye, my love, yeah What must I do If I can't spend this moment with you I'm out of mind Just help me to regain my sanity, baby Bye bye, baby Bye bye (Goodbye love) I don't really want to leave you baby I am so confused, baby (Goodbye) Good, good, goodbye baby (Goodbye love) Don't leave me baby 'Til we make love just one more time Make it seem forever This is our last and final goodbye Goodbye"
"A dreaded sunny day So I meet you at the cemetry gates Keats and Yeats are on your side A dreaded sunny day So I meet you at the cemetry gates Keats and Yeats are on your side While Wilde is on mine So we go inside and we gravely read the stones All those people, all those lives, where are they now? With-a loves and hates and passions just like mine They were born, and then they lived, and then they died Seems so unfair, I want to cry You say: ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"" And you claim these words as your own But I've read well and I've heard them said A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more If you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""'Cause there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose, who knows And who trips you up and laughs when you fall Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall You say: ""'Ere long done do does did""Words which could only be your own And then produce the text from whence was ripped Some dizzy whore, 1804 A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're happy And I meet you at the cemetry gates Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side A dreaded sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted And I meet you at the cemetry gates Keats and Yeats are on your side, but you lose 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine Sugar!"
"I get a little tongue twisted Every time I talk to you, when I see you And I'm so glad that you just missed it The way I stare to memorize your face To kiss you in my mind Love you all the time Cause when I close my eyes I still can see your smile Its bright enough to light my life Out of my darkest hour Please believe its true When I tell you I love you I've taken too many chances Searching for the truth of love, thats in my heart Tell me if I've made the wrong advances Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed Cause I know I have to do this Would you hold my hand right through it Cause when I close my eyes I still can see your smile Its bright enough to light my life Out of my darkest hour Please believe its true When I tell you I Love you Oh, Oh Had to let you just what would happen Yes I had to let you know the truth I know I've got to do this Would you hold my hand right through it Would you Cause when I close my eyes I still can see your smile Its bright enough to light my life Out of my darkest hour Cause when I close my eyes I still can see your smile Its bright enough to light my life Out of my darkest hour You know now this is true When I tell you I love you"

"Shot like an arrow going through my heart That's the pain I feel I feel whenever we're apart Not to say that I'm in love with you But who's to say that I'm not I just know that it feels wrong When I'm away too long It makes my body hot So let me tell ya baby I'll tell your mama I'll tell your friends I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend Send it in a letter baby Tell you on the phone I'm not the kinda girl Who likes to be alone I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much Baby, I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I'm rushing home Just as soon as I can I'm rushing home to see Your smiling face And feel your warm embrace It makes f-feel so g-g-g good So I'll tell you baby I'll tell your mama I'll tell your friends I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend Send it in a letter baby Tell you on the phone I'm not the kinda girl Who likes to be alone I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much Baby, I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much Baby, I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much Miss you much I miss you much I really really miss you much Miss you much I miss you much I'm not ashamed to tell the world I miss you I'll tell your mama I'll tell your friends I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend Send it in a letter baby Tell you on the phone I'm not the kinda girl Who likes to be alone I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much Baby, I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much I miss ya much Boy-oh-I miss you much Baby, I really miss you much M-I-S-S you much That's the end?"
Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo And I've been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am In a screaming ring of faces I've seen her standing in the light She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above And I'm just high on the world Come on and take a low ride with me girl On the tunnel of love It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this It's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig Money for muscle and another girl I dig Another hustle just to make it big And rockaway rockaway And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades In any shooting gallery where promises are made To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway
"I hear a voice from ten thousand miles away I have no choice, our love was meant to stay With or without, it's easy for me without a doubt As I spend my days, searching for ways Love is on the go, so is radio CHORUS Russian radio How will we ever believe you?

But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke You can't cope, you should've broke Because I ain't no joke I got a question as serious as cancer Who can keep the average dancer Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling 'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling This is what we all sit down to write You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits Get the style down pat then it's time to switch Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours The E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me So when you see me come up, freeze Or you'll be one of those seven emcees They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that They who think wrong are they who can't do that Style that I'm doing, they might ruin Patterns of paragraphs based on you and Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play Sound familiar, I'll wait till E say Play 'em, so I'mma have to diss and broke You could get a smack for this I ain't no joke I hold the microphone like a grudge B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge I hold a conversation 'cause when I invent I nominated my DJ the president When I emcee I'll keep a freestyle going steadily So pucker up and whistle my melody But whatever you do, don't miss one There'll be another rough rhyme after this one Before you know it, you're following and fiending Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning Like before the moral of my story I'm telling Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling Save it, put it in your pocket for later 'Cause I'm moving the crowd and B'll wreck a fader No interruptions and the mic is broke When I'm gone, then you can joke 'Cause everything is real on a serious tip Keep playing and I get furious quick And I'll take you for a walk through hell Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell Guide you out of triple stage darkness When it get dark again then I'ma spark this Microphone 'cause the heat is on, you see smoke And I'm finished when the beat is gone I'm no joke"

"It's snowing outside but rumbling sound Of engines roar in the night The mission is near, the confident men Are waiting to drop from the sky The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly No one should go where eagles dare Bavarian Alps that lay all around They seem to stare from below The enemy lines a long time passed Are lying deep in the snow Into the night they fall through the sky No one should fly where eagles dare They're closing in, the fortress is near It's standing high in the sky The cable cars the only way in It's really impossible to climb They make their way but maybe too late They've got to try to save the day The panicking cries, the roaring of guns Are echoing all round the valley The mission complete, they make to escape Away from the eagles nest They dared to go, where no one would try They chose to fly where eagles dare"

We got what you want Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said, ""What the...? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it"" He just smiled and said, ""Yeah def ain't it?"" It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk} So we continued to listen to it And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it So I gave a hi-five to Jeff And without hesitation popped in my cassette I took it home that night, and analyzed it Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it That Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up! You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin And spinnin and clappin, while the beatbox was groovin And screamin and yellin while on the microphone I was flowin Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, ""Yo keep goin"" So I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock People fought just to get up front To get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands..} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat! * Jeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around!

Another day is ended And I still can't sleep Remembering my yesterdays I begin to weep If I could have it over Live my life again I wouldn't change a single day I wish that I could turn back the clock Bring the wheels of time to a stop Back to the days when life was so much better Lying here in silence Picture in my hand Of a boy I still resemble But I no longer understand And as the tears run freely How I realise they were the best years of my life I wish that I could turn back the clock Bring the wheels of time to a stop Back to the days when life was so much better You might say it's just A case of giving up No But without these memories where is the love (So) Where is the love? If I could have it over Live my life again I wouldn't change a single day I wish that I could turn back the clock Bring the wheels of time to a stop Back to the days when life was so much better Why can't I turn back the clock Bring the wheels of time to a stop Back to the days Oh no no I remember when Life was so good I'd go back if I could Oh oh I wouldn't change a single day Don't let the memories slip away I wouldn't change a single day Don't let the memories slip away

Remember when we held on in the rain The night we almost lost it Once again we can take the night into tomorrow Living on feelings Touching you I feel it all again Didn't we almost have it all When love was all we had worth giving? The ride with you was worth the fall my friend Loving you makes life worth living Didn't we almost have it all? The night we hold on till the morning You know you'll never love that way again Didn't we almost have it all? The way you used to touch me felt so fine We kept our hearts together down the line A moment in the soul can last forever Comfort and keep us Help me bring the feeling back again Didn't we almost have it all When love was all we had worth giving? The ride with you was worth the fall my friend Loving you makes life worth living Didn't we almost have it all? The night we hold on till the morning You know you'll never love that way again Didn't we almost have it all? Didn't we have the best of times When love was young and new? Couldn't we reach inside and find The world of me and you? We'll never lose it again Because once you know what love is You never let it end Didn't we almost have it all When love was all we had worth giving? The ride with you was worth the fall my friend Loving you makes life worth living Didn't we almost have it all? The night we hold on till the morning You know you'll never love that way again Didn't we almost have it all? Didn't we almost have it all?

And incidents arose from circumstance One thing led to another, we were young And we would scream together songs unsung It was the heat of the moment Telling me what my heart meant The heat of the moment showed in your eyes And now you find yourself in Eighty Two The disco hot spots hold no charm for you You can concern yourself with bigger things You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings Cause it's the heat of the moment Heat of the moment The heat of the moment showed in your eyes And when your looks are gone and you're alone How many nights you sit beside the phone What were the things you wanted for yourself? Teenage ambitions you remember well It was the heat of the moment Telling me what your heart meant The heat of the moment showed in your eyes Heat of the moment Heat of the moment Heat of the moment showed in your eyes Heat of the moment Heat of the moment Heat of the moment"

Can I believe that what I saw That night was real and not just fantasy? Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me? Cause in my dreams, it's always there The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair YEAH! The night was black, was no use holding back Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me? In the mist, dark figures move and twist Was all this for real or just some kind of hell? 666 the number of the beast Hell and fire was spawned to be released Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased As they start to cry, hands held to the sky In the night, the fires are burning bright The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done 666 the number of the beast Sacrifice is going on tonight This can't go on, I must inform the law Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream? But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes 666 the number of the beast666 the one for you and me I'm coming back, I will return And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn I have the fire, I have the force I have the power to make my evil take its course"

Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt"" He turned and said in a real deep voice ""Have it your way if that's your choice And I'll put it down if you want me to put it But don't blame me if it turns into a foot Extending from the middle of your body And the next time you see your cute hottie You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do Would just kick her, so go take karate"" As I turned around to receive my injection I said ""Next time I'll use some protection"" If I see another girl and I get an erection I'm walking in the other direction 'Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor"

In the burning Heart just about to burst There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire In the warriors code there's no surrender Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never! Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you It's the paradox that drives us on It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills The victory is yours alone (x3) In the burning Heart just about to burst There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire In the burning Heart"

I've told myself so many times before But this time I think I mean it for sure We have reached a full stop Nothing's going to save us from the big drop Reached our natural conclusion Outlived the illusion I hate being in these situations That call for diplomatic relations If I only knew the answer Or I thought we had a chance Or I could stop this I would stop this thing From spreading like a cancer What can I say? I don't want to play anymore What can I say? I'm heading for the door I can't stand this emotional violence Leave in silence Leave in silence We've been running around in circles all year Doing this and that and getting nowhere This will be the last time I think I said that last time If I only had a potion Some magical lotion That could stop this I would stop this I would set the wheels in motion What can I say? I don't want to play anymore What can I say? I'm heading for the door I can't stand this emotional violence Leave in silence Leave in silence Leave in silence Leave in silence Leave in silence Leave in silence Leave in silence Leave in silence
"When there's lightning You know it always brings me down Cause it's free and I see that it's me Who's lost and never found I cry out for magic I feel it dancing in the light It was cold, lost my hold To the shadows of the night No sign of the morning coming You've been left on your own Like a rainbow in the dark A rainbow in the dark Do your Demons, do they ever let you go? When you've tried, do they hide deep inside? Is it someone that you know? You're just a picture You're an image caught in time We're a lie, you and IWe're words without a rhyme There's no sign of the morning coming You've been left on your own Like a rainbow in the dark Just a rainbow in the dark When I see lightning You know it always brings me down Cause it's free and I see that it's me Who's lost and never found Feel the magic I feel it floating in the air But it's fear and you'll hear it calling You beware, look out There's no sign of the morning coming There's no sign of the day You've been left on your own Like a rainbow, like a rainbow in the dark You're a rainbow in the dark Just a rainbow in the dark No sign of the morning You're a rainbow in the dark Whoahoohwhoaoohwhoaohhhhh"

"You'll take my life but I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand there's no turning back The bugle sounds, the charge begins But on this battlefield no one wins The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath As I plunge on into certain death Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh The horse he sweats with fear we break to run The mighty roar of the Russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the Russians fire another round We get so near yet so far away We won't live to fight another day Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh We get so close, near enough to fight When a Russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow A burst of rounds takes my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My body's numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear I draw my parting groan Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh"

Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me To find my way home? How could I be so wrong? Leaving me all alone Don't you know the hurt will cause an inferno Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame? You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry) Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected Oh... I gave you all of me (Gave me all of you) How was I to know you would weaken so easily I... I don't know what to do Now I'm all cried out (I'm all) Over you (I'm cried out, too) I... I gave you my love in vain My body never knew such pleasure My heart never knew such pain And you... (I left you so confused Now I'm all cried out) Now I'm all cried out Over you"

"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was giggling about the games That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn As I said to myself, ""look what you've done to her"" I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you Saying amor kissing you on the ear Whispering, ""I love you and I'll always be here"" Although I often reminsce I can't believe that I found A desire for true love floating around Inside my soul because my soul is cold One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old But the other half needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy I need love I need love Romance, sheer delight, how sweet? I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say, ""ooh girl, you're so sweet"" It's deja vu whenever I'm with you I could go on forever telling you what I do But where you at? You're neither here or there I swear I can't find you anywhere Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug This love search is really making me bug And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen?

I've changed, I'm no longer A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation It's taught me love and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over from the slightest touch Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive I'll search the whole world for that special girl When I finally find you watch our love unfurl I need love I need love Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen.

Spare a little candle Save some light for me Figures up ahead Moving in the trees White skin in linen Perfume on my wrist And the full moon that hangs over These dreams in the mist Darkness on the edge Shadows where I stand I search for the time On a watch with no hands I want to see you clearly Come closer than this But all I remember Are the dreams in the mist These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away Is it cloak 'n dagger Could it be spring or fall I walk without a cut Through a stained glass wall Weaker in my eyesight The candle in my grip And words that have no form Are falling from my lips These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away There's something out there I can't resist I need to hide away from the pain There's something out there I can't resist The sweetest song is silence That I've ever heard Funny how your feet In dreams never touch the earth In a wood full of princes Freedom is a kiss But the prince hides his face From dreams in the mist These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

"Now I've heard there was a secret chord That David played, and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do ya? It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth The minor fall, the major lift The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah"" Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya She tied you to a kitchen chair She broke your throne, and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah You say I took the name in vain I don't even know the name But if I did, well really, what's it to ya? There's a blaze of light in every word It doesn't matter which you heard The holy or the broken Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah I did my best, it wasn't much I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya And even though it all went wrong I'll stand before the lord of song With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Hallelujah Baby, I've been here before I know this room, I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew you And I've seen your flag on the marble arch Love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah There was a time you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show it to me, do you? And remember when I moved in you The holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"

She makes the bed and he steals the covers She likes it neat and he makes a mess I take it easy, baby, I get obsessed She's got the money and he's always broke I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke Things in common?

I saw your eyes And you made me smile For a little while I was falling in love I saw your eyes And you touched my mind Although it took a while I was falling in love I saw your eyes And you made me cry And for a little while I was falling in love I was falling in love Falling in love Falling in love Falling in love Falling in love
"(Verse 1) Love, like a road that never ends How it leads me back again To heartache I'll never understand Darling, I put my heart up on a shelf Til the moment was right, and I told myself (Chorus) The next time I fall in love I'll know better what to do The next time I fall in love Oooh The next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love It will be with you (Verse 2) Now, as I look into you eyes Well, I wonder if it's wise To hold you like I've wanted to before Tonight, I was thinking that you might Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine (Chorus) Next time I fall in love I know better what to do Next time I fall in love Oooh Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love It will be with you (Bridge) Next time I'm gonna follow through And if it drives me crazy I will know better why The next time I try (Chorus) Next time I fall in love I know better what to do Next time I fall in love Oooh Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love The next time I fall in love It will be with you (Repeat and fade) Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love Next time I fall in love"
