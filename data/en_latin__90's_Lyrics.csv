"Some dreams Live on in time forever Those dreams You want with all your heart And I'll do whatever it takes Follow through with the promise I made Put it all on the line What I hoped for at last would be mine If I could reach, higher Just for one moment touch the sky From that one moment in my life I'm gonna be stronger Know that I've tried my very best I'd put my spirit to the test If I could reach Some days Are meant to be remembered Those days We rise above the stars So I'll go the distance this time Seeing more the higher I climb That the more I believe All the more that this dream will be mine If I could reach, higher Just for one moment touch the sky From that one moment in my life I'm gonna be stronger Knowing that I've tried my very best I'd put my spirit to the test If I could reach If I could reach, higher Just for one moment touch the sky That one moment in my life I'm gonna be stronger I'm gonna be so much stronger Yes I am I put my spirit to the test If I could reach If I could, if I could If I could reach Reach, I'd reach, I'd reach I'd reach, I'd reach so Much higher"

Uh huh, yeah.. Cut up, Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones Believe in me, help me believe in anything 'Cause I wanna be someone who believes, yeah Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales And we stare at the beautiful women ""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."" Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely Well, I'm gonna paint my picture Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color I felt so symbolic yesterday If I knew Picasso, I would buy myself a gray guitar and play Mr. Jones and me look into the future Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women ""She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me.""Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely I'll never be lonely Said I'm never gonna be lonely I want to be a lion Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats We all want to be big, big stars, yeah But we got different reasons for that Believe in me, 'cause I don't believe in anything And I, I want to be someone to believe To believe, to believe, yeah! Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women ""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""I want to be Bob Dylan Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky When everybody loves you, ah son That's just about as funky as you can be Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video When I look at the television, I want to see me Staring right back at me We all want to be big stars But we don't know why, and we don't know how But when everybody loves me I want to be just about as happy as I can be Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars"

I woke up last night Thinking of you Reminiscing of These moments we spend together Let's go back to where we were And start all over again All I want it's just the chance If I could I go back in time To change my roms to rhymes All I want it's just the chance Oh I can't live without you my darling Without you I can't go on Oh I can't live without you my darling There's no reason to live for Wishing on a star Hoping dreams come true Thinking of a kiss That you and I once knew Let's go back to where we were And start all over again All I want it's just the chance If I could I go back in time To change my roms to rhymes All I want it's just the chance Oh I can't live without you my darling Sin ti me quiero morir Oh I can't live without you my darling Sin ti me muero mi amor Oh I can't live without you my darling Sin ti me quiero morir Oh I can't live without you my darling Sin ti me muero mi amor Oh I can't live without you my darling Sin ti me quiero morir Oh I can't live without you my darling Sin ti me muero mi amor No puedo vivir sin ti

Back in the summer of '69 Oh! Man, we were killin' time We were young and restless We needed to unwind I guess nothin' can last forever Forever, no... Yeah! And now the times are changin' Look at everything that's come and gone Sometimes when I play that old six string I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong Standin' on your mama's porch You told me it would last forever Oh, the way you held my hand I knew that it was now or never Those were the best days of my life Oh yeah Back in the summer of '69 Uh-huh It was the summer of '69 Oh yeah Me and my baby in a 69 Oh! Oh! It was the summer, summer, summer of 69"

"Pardon me while I burst Pardon me while I burst A decade ago, I never thought I would be At twenty-three on the verge of spontaneous combustion Woe-is-me But I guess that it comes with the territory An ominous landscape of never ending calamity I need you to hear, I need you to see That I have had all that I can take And exploding seems like a definite possibility To me So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same Not two days ago, I was having a look In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees I said, ""I can relate,"" because lately I've been Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from The burdens of the planet earth Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D But thinking so much differently So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same Never be the same, yeah Pardon me while I burst into flames Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me So pardon me while I burst into flames I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame Pardon me, pardon me...

Oh It's driven me before And it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around But lately I'm Beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there I'll be there Would you choose water over wine? Hold the wheel and drive Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there I'll be there"

"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time There's something wrong here there can be no denyin' One of us is changin' or maybe we've just stopped tryin' And it's too late baby Now it's too late Tho' we really did try to make it Somethin' inside has died And I can't hide and I just can't fake it It used to be so easy living with you You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool And it's too late baby Now it's too late Tho' we really did try to make it Somethin' inside has died and I can't hide And I just can't fake it No, no, no There'll be good times again for me and you But we just can't stay together Don't you feel it too? Still I'm glad for what we had And how I once loved you And it's too late baby Now it's too late Tho' we really did try to make it Somethin' inside has died And I can't hide and I just can't fake it No, no, baby It's too late Now darlin', it's too late Baby, it's too late"
"Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag And everything I own don't fill up half But don't you worry about the way I pack All I care about is getting back real soon A goodbye kiss is all I need from you 'Cause I'm carrying your love with me West Virginia down to Tennessee I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed Carrying your love with me It's my strength for holding on Every minute that I have to be gone I'll have everything I ever need Carrying your love with me On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain Darling all I have to do is speak your name The clouds roll back and the waters part The sun starts shining in my heart for you You're right there in everything I do 'Cause I'm carrying your love with me West Virginia down to Tennessee I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed Carrying your love with me It's my strength for holding on Every minute that I have to be gone I'll have everything I'll ever need I'm carrying your love with me I'm carrying your love with me West Virginia down to Tennessee I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed Carrying your love with me"
