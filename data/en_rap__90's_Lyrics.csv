"Hid behind the garbage can, waited for the manager He looked kind of shady, I don't think that he can handle a… Nigga that's ready to pull a TEC-9 in his left arm If he steps on, he gon' really do himself harm Keepin' calm, snatch the cheese from his hand Thinkin' about a getaway route, I jacked him for a van Jumped into the thang, slammed the door, hit the gas Now I get this feelin' someone's lookin' at my ass Looked into the rear, it was his prejudice-ass wife… Balled up on the seats cryin', ""Please don't take my life"" I grabbed her by her hair – ""Hush, bitch, don't speak"" And doin' about 110, then released her into the streets I'm pushin' a van, I made my move toward Motel 6… To rob a trick who had got himself hooked up with a bitch… Who had only one intention – to pinch him, was bein' paid The buster was gettin' played My mind started thinkin' the bitch is only for gankin' The shit started stankin' as soon as I started drankin' The first spirit told me to pay her and let her go The devil told me, ""How in the fuck can you trust a ho?"" My hands started shakin' and mentally, I was breakin' My hunger for the thrill of a kill begun achin' I'm takin' all the money, proceedin' to bust a rapin' Swiss army knife tight on the wrist and I started tapin'… A knife held to her neck through the back of the seat cushion I'm takin' the loot, then breakin' her loose from the scenery Checkin' my tracks, constantly watchin' my back What does it mean to be… Totally paranoid, thinkin' my past gonna catch up with my ass?

Unconsciously controllin' things we do and how shit go Now I'm reachin' for my Glock, my only tooler Hopin' this time I don't even have to use her At the same time, this nigga felt like eatin' Taco Bell At the same time, he did not know he 'bout to catch hell Pulled up on the lot a bit fast, I'm a little anxious Ready to get my serve on like a motherfuckin' waitress He must've noticed me, then balled out the lot fast But I can't let him pass with them out-of-state tags I hit the gas to the floor and made them dogs holler Tinted windows hidin' me inside my '78 Impala Now I'm twisted, angry, blood boilin' like some coffee Hearin' voices that go, ""Let him go and don't be foolish"" But there's a louder voice drownin' out my good intentions… Screamin', yellin', forcin' me to complete my mission Listen, temptation put me in this situation But somethin' good is the reason for my hesitation In the end, I took his car, his jewels and his life The devil made me do it Hands of the devil He made me do it, do it Hands of the devil He made me do it, do it Hands of the devil He made me do it, do it Hands of the devil He made me do it, do it Hands of the devil He made me do it, do it"

"NA Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss Always got mad when the class was dismissed But when it was in session, I always had a question I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and Help me with my problem, it was never much Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug She was married to the man, he was a thug His name was Lee, he drove a Z He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus First I'd write her name then carve a plus With my name last, on the looking glass I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by(Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on pa-- NA When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me That I should quit chasin' and look for something better But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga But, all I can do was stare Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer To get in her book and it looks rather dry I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride 'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when- Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her Wired her a letter to get her, and it went My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you When I try or make some sort of attempt, I symp Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you Then I signed sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on pa-- (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) Passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) (Nevertheless) (Nevertheless) (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again)"

"May I have your attention please The following is a brief introduction to the concept of the sunshine men Keep in mind that all instances that follow are fact and now our anthem Recently I've seen MCs comin' thru While was at home, on my couch, watchin' the boob tube Fightin' like a rough neck, just to stay loose As I sat and wrote rhymes on a page like mother goose This was the problem, results of a test The heart of all wackness, lies rooted out west Right smack dab inside my civilization The hunt for an MC brings investigation What I mean is basically there's no one Who comes off correct and stands in the sun Of Cal., but here comes the change up in trend The world debut intro to the Sunshine Men NA Let me explain this, clearly and plain About the journey of the brothers who missed this train Towards sellout When I profile rhymes go straight out the window We're not like regular bimbos We're sunshine men Just a definition of those in this hot spot who despise the system One composed of an inferior peer group Pollutin' the airwaves and I got the scoop On radio, it's all about your cash flow Pay for airplay, or you fly solo Only one brother can come up off this Those without talents, but big drug profits Rap becomes a tool often used in vain Just like a gun When they want out of the insane lifestyle But they want the insane pay So they pick up a mic, yet they have nothing to say It's a damn shame, cause they form the pack Of those who represent my spot, yet they lack The skill to get raw with words and cold shoot 'em Stuck in the past, puttin' raps to a drum computer Not even worried that the songs not able Cause they got juice and hook-ups at big labels No unique-ness, no goals or dreams No creativity's exactly how it seems As a sunshine man, with plans and a pen in my hand Recordin' thoughts and beats for the next man Even those who live without a clue I bring the truth to you, it's not new To help my cause, the rise or inflation The incline of western civilization Words to enlighten and to direct Brought to you live and correct From Sunshine Men NA NA Why in the world is every one down with sunshine? None of them from here, but the attitude's clear They stroll like kings, the big fish in a small stream Too weak to battle so they fled the big apple And they moved out west like old settlers Booty MCs, no rhymes, with a swelled head Aimin' to discover an inactive rhyme zone Just like Columbus, they called here home So they moved in and started a new trend West Coast stars made from East Coast pollution Native MCs never got the game plan So they grabbed the trumpets and hopped in the band But no, not me, neither I, nor D(?) Seeks to shade from sunshine Underneath trees of confusion Because this illusion is grim We choose to stay clear minded As sunshine men"

"See, most of my life I never had shit I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth Thinking, ""Was I really supposed to be on this planet earth?""I take a deep breath and then another follows 'Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow See, it's rough being a loner Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner See, people got it bad from jump-street And being short is just another strike against me I used to get funny looks 'cause I was small And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall Given the odds I was up against, bro The average nigga would've quit a long time ago But now I've got a record out I'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out Now, I'm the spice around town It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around I got friends and bitches on my dick But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe And every different day it's a different fuckin' ho And now that my pockets are getting bigger I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga They tell me that they love me and all that But really they just wait for me to fall flat So they can get me for my income Take me for all I got, and then some Like Trina, you dig? I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid Knowing that she used the baby to use me Took him out my life, mentally abusing me But as the time went by, I got another slimmy And she was just like the first one screaming, ""Gimme"" But not in the exact same way She had a different type of game she liked to play Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type And for a little while, shit seemed alright But just like the first ho, homie When shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me And it's getting out of hand, G 'Cause nobody seems to understand me Reminiscing got me feeling kinda low I broke out the Everclear and then I drunk some mo' Until it was all gone Now I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on But not just anybody, G I'ma take that on Tamica, 'cause she's the closest to me Full of that Everclear and high on that buddah Get to the house, all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her 'Cause shooting her would be sweet But you know what'd be sweeter? If I make her shoot me Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking I'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her She still wouldn't grab the gun And at that time, I wasn't thinking about no one Damn near crazy, I went and grabbed the baby (Bill! Gimme the baby! Gimme the baby!) Held him by the door and said I'ma throw his ass out, ho She went to crying, ""Somebody stop him""I said, ""You better grab the motherfuckin' gun or I'mma drop him"" She snatched the baby out of my hands We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting When we fell on the bed, check this shit All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head So I ran and got the gun and came back to her Loaded it up and handed the gat to her I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle She screamed, ""Stop,"" and then we broke into another tussle Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick Damn—Ah shit, I'm hit (Oh, Lord! Oh, Bill!) Ahh... my eye, I can't see (Oh, I'm so sorry!) Why you shot me in the eye? (Oh my God, somebody help me!) I would've shot you in the body (Oh, I'm sorry!) Why you shot me in the eye? Riding in the ambulance, everything is hectic I can't get a grip, I just can't check this Everybody's crying, could it be I'm dying? Bullet in my head, in the bed I was lying Where's 'Mica? I wanna tell her I love her With an IV in my arm, I took a picture for an album cover Goddamn, this shit's a trip, G Five different doctors with needles tryna stick me I hear my family hollering, ""He needs us!""During the confusion, man, I seen Jesus My mom's on the phone, long-distance, from New York Here comes the doctors again, trying to rip me apart I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake this I'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it But I'ma make it, 'cause something's steady urging me Five hours passed, I made it through surgery And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night But God told me, ""Everything is gonna be alright"" And I'm glad that I'm here, GBut it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly"

"(So what you gonna do when you get outta here cat daddy?) I don't know dawg. I'm just trying to live it one day at a time, ya know? (I hear you talkin' man, live it one day at a time...) (It ain't nothing but a thang though, bro) Yeah I hear you fool... Well let me get up outta here, my ride out here waitin' for me (Alright cat daddy, take it easy baby) You stay up fool (Peace) He greets his father with his hands out Rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child The world is different since he's seen it last Out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last All he had was his mother's letters Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better But he's black so he's got one strike against him And he's young, plus he came up in the system But he's smart and he's finally making eighteen And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean So he's calling up his homie who done came up Livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff And had that attitude that who he was was worth land And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man Now it's different, he done did dirt And realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt And can't nobody change this It's 1994 and we up against the same shit I never understood why I could never see a man cry 'til I seen a man die Imagine life at it's full peak Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy Imagine peace on this Earth when there's no grief Imagine grief on this Earth when there's no peace Everybody's got a different way of endin' it And when your number comes for souls, then they send it in Now your time has arrived for your final test I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath How much longer will it be 'til it's all done? Total darkness at ease be at all one I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate You took his life, but your memory you'll never take You'll be headed to another place And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face I still gotta wonder why I never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low Stop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here You start your journey into outer space You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place So you standing in the tunnel of eternal life And you see the ones you never learn to love in life Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up But if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free Here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace I still got to wonder why I never seen a man cry 'til I seen that man die"

I look around and I say ""This!"" And I could give a fuck if the nigga gets pissed Cause if he wants a chunk I'm a get up in his shit Scarface: Creepin' comin' up a yellow stonin' Put my shit in park and drunk a St. Ises with my homey Reminisced on fast times past times and shit Smokin' on some bud I came acroos my nigga Kick I gave my boy some dap and asked him what's the haps Chillin' with this girl and a gat across his laps I knew he had some drama I didn't even have to ask it Now where were them bitches at it's time to kick some asses He told what had happened and now I'm thinkin' ""fuck"" I'm callin' up South Acres it's time to get 'em up My motherfuckin' neighborhood is quick to get with static Never showin' fear cause these niggas never had it Everybody's trapped, quick to go to war Quick to kill your ass quick to jack your car So if you see some shit then I suggest you punch it Cause what's about to happen you may not be able to stomach Killers killers killers steady smokin' fry So nigga lay it down or die motherfuckers die Fuckin' with my family you dick is in the paint So don't think that it's shit cause niggero it ain't Shit to break 'em off I'm breakin' 'em off with chunks Siggedy south iggedy acres ain't no motherfuckin' punks And drive-by shootin' ain't the motherfuckin' shit Cause niggas plot hits after motherfuckin' hits Killin' you ass for kicks doin' shit for the murder And since you want me to die you gots to die cause you deserve ta Now here take this motherfuckin' slug (bang) Cause fuckin' with the kid is the grounds of being drugged Mister mister Face the hardest nigga being heard Cause all I have in this world is my balls and my word I'm sick of motherfuckers thinkin' they run shit Until you face to face wiith Scarface you ain't done shit I'm killin' off you mark ass niggas with a slug from a Glock motherfuckers I'm a born killer, I really thought you knew bitch I'm slappin' hoes and cappin' fools It ain't shit"

Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, ho? Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?

"Wild skies Full moon and thoughts collide We look for answers in those catatonic, bloodshot eyes The eyes that vomit are the ones that are in love Those aren't tears They're just bad bad blood Just bad bad blood Wild lives The big surprise We get our clues from what The funhouse mirrors authorize A ray of thought turns happy endings into mud Where there's denial, there's bad blood Do you remember the strain? Do you remember the pain? Do you remember the cause or the blame? Bad Blood! Do you remember need? Do you remember lust? Do you surrender your greed or your trust? Bad Blood! Wild eyes He's finally come alive How'd all things mediocre Wind up all things all the time A steady stream of madness Rises to a flood The clock is ticking for bad blood Do you remember the strain? Do you remember the pain? Do you remember the cause or the blame? Bad Blood! Do you remember need? Do you remember lust? Do you surrender your greed or your trust? Bad Blood!"
"After laughter comes tears Check the script, me and the gods gettin' ripped Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip Had a box, 'boom boom' the bass would blast We was laughin' at all the girls that passed Conversation, brothers had began to discuss (Hey yo, Rob, remember that kid you bust?) Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far 'Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha Not knowin' exactly what lied ahead My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner ""Hey, Shorty, check it, run the bag and the dough!"" But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!"" Money splattered him, BOW! Then he snatched the bag Hit his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block (Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!) I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet I saw the blood all over the hot concrete I picked him up, then I held him by his head His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was… Aw man! How do I say goodbye? It's always the good ones that have to die Memories in the corner of my mind Flashbacks, of us laughin' all the time I taught him all about the bees and birds But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words After laughter comes tears Me and my man, my ace Big Moe from the shelter 'Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma Now, Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed Three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex!He seemed to ignore, I said, ""Be for real! She's not even worth it to go raw deal."" A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do He got butt-naked and stuck the power U Twenty minutes went by, Moe, I'm out without a doubt I'm not pumpin' up, I am airin' out Hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story But he carried on with the same old stuff With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck Moe tried to be down with O.P.P Ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the H.I.V Now no life to live, doc says two more years So after the laughter I guess comes the tears After laughter comes tears"
"I rip shit like a bow when I flow And I score points with the joints that I throw Cause I flow daily, I'm no punk, see I break backs, make tracks and get funky There's no one to run to cause nobody cares MC's drop to your knees, say your prayers The luck of the Irish is about to kick in Prepare to die and notify your next of kin I'm going all out, buck, duck and call out That's how I'm living, punk you better stall out This is the House of Pain To come inside is insane I'll put your head out (4x) Jump up spread out I'll put your head out I'll put your head out Put put your head out Jump up spread out I'll put your head out Hey what up punk? I'll put your head out Who steps to booz? When the hoods wanna take a cruise They're feeling effects of the booze Ain't no clues, to hell with them fools Who got smoked even though they strap tools They got brews but I got the boomer Trigger to blast you and skip the bull Take my life shit, I'll take you to school In a duel, what's the difference if you think you're dropping jewels? Carbon copy, think you're so cool Stop dreaming and hallucinating You're caught up in a piece I'm painting Click click, punk, now you're thinking ""Oh shit!"" Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead Blessed with the gift, and gets with the rhyme I never say quit when I'm out to get mine It's live and let die, sit back and get high Smoking a fat blunt, waiting for some punk To act up like he's got something in him Then I grab the mic and start spitting out venom Carving up headstones, blowing out headphones Stepping to me, you'll wind up in the Dead Zone It's nothing personal, that's how it goes, G Step up with beef and you'll wind up losing teeth Cause I don't give up the mic that easy Step back, this ain't government cheese, G You can stand in line, but you ain't getting it Talk all the shit you want, but I ain't sweating it"
