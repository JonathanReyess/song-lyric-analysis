"The warden threw a party in the county jail The prison band was there and they began to wail The band was jumping and the joint began to swing You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing Let's rock, everybody, let's rock Everybody in the whole cell block Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang Let's rock, everybody, let's rock Everybody in the whole cell block Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock Number forty-seven said to number three ""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see I sure would be delighted with your company Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"" Let's rock, everybody, let's rock Everybody in the whole cell block Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone Way over in the corner weeping all alone The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"" Let's rock, everybody, let's rock Everybody in the whole cell block Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"" Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, ""Nix nix I want to stick around a while and get my kicks."" Let's rock, everybody, let's rock Everybody in the whole cell block Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock"
