lyrics
"All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me Somebody I can love for them All this money don't mean shit If you ain't got nobody to share it with Love rules the world, you feel me He don't understand you like I do No he'll never make love to you like I do So give it to me Cause I can show you 'bout a real love And I can promise anything that I do Is just to satisfy you When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but We one in the same girl, it ain't a game So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you In good and bad times, we'll always make it through Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you I could straight lace you, not just appearance Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void When you spend time with your woman and listen It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt And prove to you you're more important than anything else Worthwhile, special like my first child When I see your face it's always like the first time Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to Let it be known, I told you And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby) Waiting for love like this too long (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby) All that you need I can give you (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on) I do, satisfy you (You don't have to wait on him) I'm the light when you can't see I'm that air when you can't breathe I'm that feeling when you can't leave Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive So it's only you and me When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong Keep you away from harm, my love is protected I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil Make love all night, bending bed coils You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal This is all for you, cause I simply adore you until fade This one right here goes out to all my sisters"

"NA I throw my tape on then, I watch ya Three seconds later, I got ya Shakin' your head, dancin' instead of sittin' The rhymes kick, the beats hittin' you Just like a home run, slammin' like a slam dunk Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk It happened to James like it happened to me How you think I feel to see another MC get paid Usin' my rap style And I'm playin' the background meanwhile I ain't with that, you can't forget that You took my style, I'm takin' it back Comin' back, like ""Return of the Jedi""Sucker MC's in the place that said I Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds But never rock records, how ya like me now? How ya like me now? How ya like me now? Now brothers are riding me like a pony I'm no phony, I'm the only real mic-aroni Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played New jacks, you all shoulda stayed Out of the business, what is this Amateur night at the Apollo? Get off this stage, I'm in a rage I'm like a lion that's been trapped inside a cage I'm the real king, rap is a jungle I never understood, how could one go To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me Become a rapper, then try to rock me Schemin' like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin' I'm from the old school, I used to see men Die for less, but I'm not living that way I'll let my mic do the talkin' And let the music play How ya like me now? Rap is an art and I'm like Picasso But of course, why else would you try so Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer Every time I rocked the mic, I left a Stain in your brain that will remain Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me Again, respect, I come correct The rhymes I select are nothing short of perfect Vernacular's pure and I can ensure Life or death with my breath, my voice is a cure I heal life from the words I spread I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say, ""Ow"" And she's jockin', now how ya like me now? How ya like me now? How ya like me now? It irked my nerve when I heard A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve Run around town sayin' he is the best Is that a test? I'm not impressed Get real, you're nothing but a toy Don't ya know that I'll serve that boy? Just like a waiter, hit 'em with a plate of These fresh rhymes and Make sure that he pay the bill And leave him standin' still When he's had enough, hit him with a refill And for dessert it won't be no ice cream I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dreams Make him feel the wrath, beat him down, and laugh And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him""Who is the best?"" And if he don't say, ""Moe Dee"" I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet But if we ever did, how could you beat me? You're so petrified, you're scared to even meet me My word's the law, that's why you don't beef You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief So I'm puttin' you on punishment, just like a child Never touch another mic, how ya like me now? How ya like me now? I could continue, there's more on the menu But I'll relax 'cause I'm so far in you You had enough, I know you're overstuffed And if I keep going, you'll be throwin' up Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day When you used to come to my parties and pay Nobody's ever gonna rock me and this I vow So all I wanna say is how ya like me now? How ya like me now? How ya like me now? How ya like me now?"

I don't know so that's why I ask Maybe it's true that I set myself up But then again it's the question I asked I want someone for me who is straight A kind of cutie. Yes, yep, a smart mate I've been around searching for the right one But it seems like a waste of my time Every time that I meet the right 1 It seems as if she plays with my mind So it makes me on the defense side Because my offense is sort of slow It doesn't pay to tell someone ""I love you"" Because in my vocab ""I love u"" is a no, no I think I give in. My feelings, they show I think I'd better not look back I've been down a little too long And now it's time that I get on track So I must... Chorus I like to mingle when I do mingle I love to mingle when I do flirt I get off hand and tell the stories About my past & that's when it hurts But I need to find for me a lonesome lady type Who wants me for self A woman who wants me because of Father Not for the fame or for my wealth So I can ""Show her how I feel"" Yeah, ladies I'm not that picky But being picky is just for self I must protect what I respect And that is me & not someone else I've been mistreated up on the downhill Back in the days I used to be strong I used to flirt, hurt, kind of jerk Get the cash, the sex then I'm gone But payback is a mother And now I don't know who to trust So I just... Chorus Yeah, you know women? Yeah they tell me I'm lovely & cuddly but I just don't understand why they want to play with my feelings. But it won't happen again Nah, never (No, no no no no no...) So listen ladies I'll treat you How you treat me back in return I'm not rude. No, I'm not stuck up But my feelings are my main concern So don't think that I'd give in Cause now I know how to show My feelings when I get involved I'll take it slow before I say ""Oh, No"" I'll treat you like you treat me I'll be straight loyal & all So don't take advantage of Father Because I'll step up but not crawl So give me what you can give me Love, attention, a lot of respect I don't ask for a whole lot But I'm gone if you wanna step That's why I like to take it slow Not rush because I want more The next time that I fall in love Hmm, you bets I'll be sure (I'm gonna treat you...) Chorus So ladies... now y'all know how I'm living... & y'all know what I'm about. And that's the end. So if you feel you can commit, come & give it a shot"

"I shall not fear no man but God Though I walk through the valley of death I shed so many tears If I should die before I wake Please God walk with me Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven Back in elementary, I thrived on misery Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest Tell me, can you feel me?

Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain Show me some happiness again I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?

Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come Lord! (God!) I suffered through the years And shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high This ain't the life for me, I wanna change But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game I'm trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door Shed so many tears Lord, lost so many peers And shed so many tears I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Lord, I suffered many years And shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers And shed so many tears"

"NA Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss Always got mad when the class was dismissed But when it was in session, I always had a question I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and Help me with my problem, it was never much Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug She was married to the man, he was a thug His name was Lee, he drove a Z He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus First I'd write her name then carve a plus With my name last, on the looking glass I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by(Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on pa-- NA When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me That I should quit chasin' and look for something better But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga But, all I can do was stare Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer To get in her book and it looks rather dry I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride 'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when- Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her Wired her a letter to get her, and it went My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you When I try or make some sort of attempt, I symp Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you Then I signed sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on pa-- (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) Passing me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) (Nevertheless) (Nevertheless) (Nevertheless, I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again) She keeps on passing me by She keeps on passing me by (I'll say it again)"

"A lonely mother gazing out of the window Staring at a son that she just can't touch If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much But all the praying just ain't helping at all Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation But he just can't see She gives him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me""One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face His health is fading and he doesn't know why Three letters took him to his final resting place Y'all, don't hear me Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (Your way or no way) But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Come on!I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew Clear  blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein? What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane, and name this day in time For falling prey to crime I say the system's got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast) Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go) Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (I know, I know, your way hey) But I think you're moving too fast"

We're not in right now But if you leave your name and number We'll get back to you, to you, to you"" (laughing) I got all this love, waiting just for you I just gotta know, that your love is true Can't keep running boy, in and out my life Wanna be your girl, not cause the mood is right If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide Will you be there for me, when I need someone to hold me Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man I just need a little time, before I invest my love Don't walk away boy, (ooh don't walk away) My love won't hurt you (no no) Don't walk away boy I'll be right there for you You say all the things, that I like to hear You push all my buttons baby Love to have you close to me Wanna feel your love, wanna be for sure That it's me you need baby, each and every night Baby, don't misunderstand I want you for my man I need a little time Before I give you my love Don't walk away boy I'll be right there for you Don't walk away This is what it sounds like When we're making love Don't walk away boy Don't walk away boy I'll be right there for you (Till fade)"
