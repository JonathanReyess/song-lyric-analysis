"My friend's got a girlfriend Man, he hates that bitch He tells me every day He says, ""Man, I really gotta lose my chick In the worst kind of way."" She sits on her ass He works his hands to the bone To give her money every payday But she wants more dinero just to stay at home Well, my friend, you gotta say ""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job?""Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job?"" I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough To keep her bill collectors at bay I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough 'Cause that girl's got expensive taste ""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job?"" Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job?"" Well, I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at all But hey man, free rides just don't come along Every day Let me tell you about my other friend now My friend's got a boyfriend Man, she hates that dick She tells me every day He wants more dinero just to stay at home Well, my friend, you gotta say ""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job?"" Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job?"" ""I won't give you no money, I always pay Na-na, why don't you get a job?"" Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way Na-na, why don't you get a job?"" Hey! That's something everyone can enjoy"
A green plastic watering can For a fake Chinese rubber plant In a fake plastic earth That she bought from a rubber man In a town full of rubber plans To get rid of itself It wears her out It wears her out It wears her out It wears her out She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles and burns He used to do surgery For girls in the 80s But gravity always wins And it wears him out It wears him out It wears him out It wears... She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love But I can't help the feeling I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run And it wears me out It wears me out It wears me out It wears me out And if I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted All the time All the time
"When you were young, and your heart was an open book You used to say, ""Live and let live"" (You know you did, you know you did, you know you did) But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin' Makes you give in and cry Say, ""Live and let die"" Live and let die What does it matter to ya? When you got a job to do You got to do it well You got to give the other fella hell NA You used to say, ""Live and let live"" (You know you did, you know you did, you know you did) But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin' Makes you give in and cry Say, ""Live and let die"" Live and let die"

You could say I lost my faith in science and progress You could say I lost my belief in the holy church You could say I lost my sense of direction You could say all of this and worse but If I ever lose my faith in you There'd be nothing left for me to do Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world You could say I lost my faith in the people on TVYou could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians They all seemed like game show hosts to me If I ever lose my faith in you There'd be nothing left for me to do I could be lost inside their lies without a trace But every time I close my eyes I see your face I never saw no miracle of science That didn't go from a blessing to a curse I never saw no military solution That didn't always end up as something worse but Let me say this first If I ever lose my faith in you (If I ever lose my faith in you) There'd be nothing left for me to do (There'd be nothing left for me to do) If I ever lose my faith If I ever lose my faith If I ever lose my faith If I ever lose my faith If I ever lose my faith In you In you In you In you In you

"You had something to hide Should have hidden it, shouldn't you? Now you're not satisfied With what you're being put through It's just time to pay the price For not listening to advice And deciding in your youth On the policy of truth Things could be so different now It used to be so civilised You will always wonder how It could have been if you'd only lied It's too late to change events It's time to face the consequence For delivering the proof In the policy of truth Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time before Now you're standing there tongue-tied You'd better learn your lesson well Hide what you have to hide And tell what you have to tell You'll see your problems multiplied If you continually decide To faithfully pursue The policy of truth Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time before NA Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time before Never again is what you swore The time before"

"What we've got here is failure to communicate Some men, you just can't reach So, you get what we had here, last week Which is the way he wants it Well, he gets it *Whistling*And I don't like it any more than you men Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before Look at the hate we're breeding Look at the fear we're feeding Look at the lives we're leading The way we've always done before My hands are tied The billions shift from side to side An' the wars go on with brainwashed pride For the love of God and our human rights An' all these things are swept aside By bloody hands, time can't deny An' are washed away by your genocide An' history hides the lies of our civil wars NA D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man Who said peace could last forever? An' in my first memories, they shot Kennedy I went numb when I learned to see So I never fell for Vietnam We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands When everybody's fightin' for their promised land And I don't need your civil war It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no Look at the shoes you're filling Look at the blood we're spilling Look at the world we're killing The way we've always done before Look in the doubt we've wallowed Look at the leaders we've followed Look at the lies we've swallowed An' I don't want to hear no more My hands are tied For all, I've seen has changed my mind But still, the wars go on, as the years go by With no love of God or human rights An' all these dreams are swept aside By bloody hands of the hypnotized Who carry the cross of homicide And history bears the scars of our civil wars NA We practice selective annihilation Of mayors and government officials For example, to create a vacuum Then we fill that vacuum As popular war advances Peace is closer I don't need your civil war It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war No no no no no no no no no no no no I don't need your civil war I don't need your civil war Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war No no no no no no no no no no, no, no I don't need one more war Ooh, I don't need one more war No no no, no woah, no woah What's so civil 'bout war anyway?"
You look like a perfect fit For a girl in need of a tourniquet But can you save me Come on and save me If you could save me From the ranks of the freaks Who suspect they could never love anyone 'Cause I can tell You know what it's like The long farewell Of the hunger strike But can you save me Come on and save me If you could save me From the ranks of the freaks Who suspect they could never love anyone You struck me dumb Like radium Like Peter Pan Or Superman You will come to save me C'mon and save me If you could save me From the ranks of the freaks Who suspect they could never love anyone 'Cept the freaks Who suspect they could never love anyone But the freaks Who suspect they could never love anyone C'mon and save me Why don't you save me If you could save me From the ranks of the freaks Who suspect they could never love anyone Except the freaks Who suspect they could never love anyone Except the freaks who could never love anyone
